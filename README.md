# ProjectEulerSolutions

A collection of solutions to problems listed on projecteuler.net. I started solving these problems both to learn c++ and because I just find it fun to try problems like these.

Here are some of the problems I had the most fun working out or at least used an interesting technique to solve.

- 67 - Maximum Path Sum II. 
  - Nice, simple example of dynamic programming.
- 120 - Square Remainders.
  - Can use the binomial expansion and some number theory to reduce the solution space.
- 135 - Same Differences. 
  - Can use some algebra and some number theory to reduce the solution space.
- 141 - Progressive Perfect Squares. 
  - Can use some algebra to reduce the solution space.
